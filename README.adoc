= podinfo

App that returns some info about the pod it is running in.

== Developing

I recommend using https://github.com/codegangsta/gin[gin] for livereload during development:

    gin --build cmd/server

To make sure everything builds as expected, use `make server` to build the
binary locally and `make image` to build the docker image.
